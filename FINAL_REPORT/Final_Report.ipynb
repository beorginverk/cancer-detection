    "<p>Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer, with 1 in 5 Americans developping it by the time they reach 70 years old. Over 2 people die of skin cancer in the US every hour.<sup>[1]</sup> \n",
    "Early detection is key in saving peoples lives with skin cancer, with the early detection 5 year survival rate being 99%<sup>[1]</sup>. Dermatologist have to look at patients one by one, and must assess by eye whether or not a blemish is malignant or benign. Dermatologist's have around a 66% accuracy rate in assessing 752 different skin diseases, while CNN's, such as the one detailed in *Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks* published in Nature have achieved greater accuracy levels then dermatologist's, around 72.1%<sup>[2]</sup>.<br>\n",
    "<p>By converting cancer detection to easily deployable software, you could allow people to get accurate cancer testing at home, saving resources and time. By making cancer detection more accesible, people would be more likely to get tested, saving lives in the process. Below I will detail my process and results from a melanoma (malignant), nevus (benign) , and seborrheic keratosis (benign) ,detector model using Convoltional Neural Networks.<br>"
